\section{Introduction}

The \gls{LBM} is a numerical scheme based on a discretization of the \gls{BTE} used to simulate fluid dynamics, introduced by \citeauthor{McNamara1988LBM} \cite{McNamara1988LBM}.

This report discusses an implementation of the \gls{LBM} and analyses its scaling properties in the context of the course \textit{High-Performance Computing: Fluid Mechanics with Python} at the University of Freiburg. The implementation is done completely in Python using the NumPy\footnote{NumPy version 1.23} \cite{NumPy} library for efficient numerical calculations and the \gls{MPI}\footnote{MPI version 4.0} \cite{MPI40} with mpi4py\footnote{mpi4py version 3.1} \cite{mpi4py} as bindings for the parallelization. For simplicity, the problem is restricted to the 2D case.

The code associated with this report as well as introduction on how to run it can be found on GitHub\footnote{\therepository}.
